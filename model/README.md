# Model

* [Training the prediction inference network](amortized_prediction)
* [Training the reconstruction inference network](amortized_reconstruction)
* [Scripts for analyzing model output (retention probabilities)](analyze_model_output)
* [Optimizing retention probabilities, and deriving model surprisal](compute_surprisal)
* [Training LSTM prior (not used in the paper, which instead uses GPT2)](lstm_prediction)
* [Common utilities](shared)

The codebase was developed and run under Python 3.7 using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) version ``1.7.1+cu101``.
