\section{Stimuli (Reading Time Studies)}\label{sec:stimulus-pool}


The stimuli were constructed subject to the following constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The critical verb and the second-to-last verb phrase were neither identical, strongly similar (e.g. annoyed and startled), nor were they differentially semantically similar in the \textsc{Compatible} and \textsc{Incompatible} conditions. For instance, if the inner verb is ``annoyed'' in the \textsc{Compatible} condition, the final verb cannot be ``startled''.
	\item In Experiment 2, the last word in the second-to-last verb phrase was identical across the \textsc{Compatible} and \textsc{Incompatible} conditions.
		While the Maze paradigm largely avoids spillover effects, this constraint helps remove any remaining doubt that spillover could impact the comparison between \textsc{Compatible} and \textsc{Incompatible}.
	\item In Experiment 2, the overall distribution of COCA log word frequency of the second-to-last verb, across the items, was matched in the \textsc{Compatible} and \textsc{Incompatible} conditions. This was done to avoid any possibility of increased difficulty due to rare lexical items spilling over to the final verb.
\end{enumerate}
These constraints had not been consistently enforced in the preceding experiments (Section~\ref{sec:previous}).
While they rigorously rule out various potential confounds, we did not observe evidence that these constraints had an impact on the effects of interest in either the model predictions or human reading times.



\subsection{Stimuli (Experiment 1)}\label{sec:stimulus-pool-1}

For each item, we show the full version in the \textsc{Three} condition.
The other conditions are obtained by removing one or both embedded clauses.
For each item, we also indicate the semantic groups of nouns that we paired it with (see Section~\ref{sec:nouns}).

\subsection{Stimuli (Experiment 2)}\label{sec:stimulus-pool-2}
Formatting is as in Section~\ref{sec:stimulus-pool-1}.
For the second-to-last verb phrase, the show the \textsc{Incompatible} and \textsc{Compatible} version, separated by a slash.
